// retired - RE5 has no holster mechanic, so Hand to Hand isn't reachable
// during normal play and doesn't need its own hook; "Normal" is treated
// as the universal profile per user decision).
//
// UNLIKE the old block, this one is a tight back-to-back struct copy
// (fld [eax+N] / fstp [edx+N] per field, no interleaved computation).
// +446895 was reached in two steps: extrapolating the confirmed
// +0x00/+0x04 pair spacing forward predicted +446894 (one byte early),
// which crashed the game on level load - Windows Error Reporting showed
// exception 0xc0000096 (STATUS_PRIVILEGED_INSTRUCTION) at fault offset
// +446895, meaning some other branch in the function jumps directly into
// that byte and our 5-byte JMP patch (starting at +446894) corrupted it.
// Shifting the hook to +446895 (the address the crash dump itself
// pointed to) confirmed working in-game 2026-07-27: clean level load,
// F4 toggled the override on/off repeatedly with correct visible results,
// no crashes. Same reasoning as the old block still applies: this is the
// instruction *after* the last field write (FOV), never mid-sequence, so
// nothing is left to clobber our override on the same frame.
//
// This is NOT a normal call boundary - execution just falls through into
// this address sequentially as part of the surrounding function, so the
// stub must preserve every register/flag it touches.

// Aim Camera naked hook stub, installed at re5dx9.exe+4466E9 (2026-07-27) -
// the Aim Camera state's write-sequence block, found live via Cheat Engine
// the same way as the Normal block above (trainer's Aim Camera tab,
// exact-value scan while holding aim, "find out what writes"). Same
// relative field layout as Normal/the original Hand-to-Hand struct
// (confirmed: the write to +0x00 landed at esi+0x420, and the very next
// field write in the same trace landed at esi+0x424, matching the known
// +0x04 = Vertical Distance offset) - but this struct is embedded inside
// a larger object at a large, disp32-encoded offset (esi+0x420) rather
// than being its own small allocation based directly in a register like
// the Normal block's EDX. So the struct base ApplyOverride() needs is
// ESI+0x420, not ESI itself.
//
// The hook address was first calculated the same way as the Normal
// block's - extrapolating the confirmed +0x00/+0x04 pair spacing (here
// 9 bytes/field: 3-byte fld + 6-byte fstp, since esi+0x420 and beyond
// all need disp32 encoding) through to the end of the FOV (+0x24) pair.
// Two extrapolated guesses (+4466E9, then +4466ED corrected from the
// first crash's WER fault offset) both crashed the game on level load -
// the second crash (0xc0000005 ACCESS_VIOLATION at fault offset
// +4466E8, not matching the clean "corrupted JMP byte" pattern the first
// crash and the Normal block's crash both showed) didn't point at an
// obvious next guess, so extrapolation was abandoned in favor of reading
// Cheat Engine's disassembly directly, field by field via repeated
// "find out what writes" captures. That surfaced a real surprise no
// extrapolation could have predicted: the write sequence **skips +0x0C
// entirely** (goes straight from +0x08 Distance's write to +0x10
// Horizontal Adjustment's, no pair between them - consistent with the
// Normal/original struct, which also never showed a +0x0C write), and
// there's an extra `mov eax,[esi+0x2B8]` instruction reloading the
// source pointer immediately before the FOV field's `fld`, something no
// byte-counting could have anticipated. The confirmed FOV write
// completes at 008466D7 (`fstp [esi+0x444]`, 6 bytes), so the real
// hook point - read directly off the disassembly, not calculated - is
// the very next instruction, 008466DD (`re5dx9.exe+4466DD`). Confirmed
// working in-game 2026-07-27: clean level load, F4 toggled the override
// correctly while aiming, no crashes.
